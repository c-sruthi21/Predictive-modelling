Problem 1: Linear Regression

The comp-activ database is a collection of computer systems activity measures.
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very CPU-bound programs. 

As you are a budding data scientist you thought to find out a linear equation to build a model to predict 'usr'(Portion of time (%) that cpu runs in user mode) and to find out how each attribute affects the system to be in 'usr' mode using a list of system attributes.

Problem 2: Logistic Regression

You are a statistician at the Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Health and you are provided with data of 1473 females collected from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or did not know if they were at the time of the survey.

The problem is to predict do/don't they use a contraceptive method of choice based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
